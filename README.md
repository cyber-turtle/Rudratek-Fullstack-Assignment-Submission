# Project Tracking System Assignment

A simple full-stack task to manage and track projects, built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Next.js for my Rudratek Fullstack Assignment.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: View all projects with search, filtering (by status), and sorting.
- **Project Details**: View comprehensive project information.
- **Status Management**: Update project status with valid state transitions (Active <-> On Hold, -> Completed).
- **Correctness**: Backend validation using Zod prevents invalid data and state transitions.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (Sequelize), Zod (Validation)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Axios, Lucide React

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- postgreSQL (made a last minute switch after buiding on mongodb, tried to get railway to work with mongoDB just to find out mongoDB was currently down on railway )

## Note

- Although not a good practice,i left the .env file in the repository for ease of use as pertaining to this project it isnt sensitive information.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```

   _Note: This populates the database with sample data (its optional but incase you want to test the application quickly)._

3. Start the server (runs on port 5000):
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   _Note: Ensure PostgreSQL is running._

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Documentation

### Projects

### 1. List Projects `GET /projects`

- **Query Params**:
  - `status`: Filter by status (`active`, `on_hold`, `completed`)
  - `search`: Search by project name or client name (case-insensitive)
  - `sort`: Sort field (`createdAt`, `startDate`, `-startDate`)
- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "_id": "651a...",
      "name": "Website Redesign",
      "status": "active",
      "clientName": "Acme Corp",
      "startDate": "2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
  ```

### 2. Create Project `POST /projects`

- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "New App",
    "clientName": "TechStart",
    "startDate": "2023-11-01",
    "budget": 5000
  }
  ```
- **Validation**: `endDate` must be after `startDate`.

### 3. Get Project `GET /projects/:id`

- **Response**: Full project object.

### 4. Update Status `PATCH /projects/:id/status`

- **Body**:
  ```json
  { "status": "completed" }
  ```
- **Rules**:
  - `active` ↔ `on_hold`
  - `active` → `completed`
  - `on_hold` → `completed`
  - `completed` cannot be changed.

### 5. Delete Project `DELETE /projects/:id`

- **Response**: `{ "message": "Project removed" }`

## AI Usage Disclosure

**Tools Used:**

- **Gemini 3.0 Flash (via Google Antigravity)**: Used for generating boilerplate code, setting up project structure, writing Zod schemas, and crafting Tailwind UI components.

**Usage Breakdown:**

- **Backend (Fully Generated & Verified)**:
  - Express server setup, Sequelize models, and Zod validation logic were generated by AI.
  - **Verification**: Manually reviewed Zod schemas and Sequelize hooks to ensure `endDate >= startDate` validation and correct enum values for status. Tested API endpoints using Postman.

- **Frontend (Generated & Refined)**:
  - **Dashboard**: Initial layout and logic generated.
  - **Refinement**: Manually refined the UI to match the specific "Project Tracker" design request (white background, specific font, pill badges).
  - **Components**: `StatusBadge` and `ProjectCard` were generated then customized manually for the visual polish requirements.

- **Debugging (Assisted)**:
  - Used AI to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL due to Railway service issues.

**What I Understand Fully:**

- The entire data flow from PostgreSQL -> Sequelize -> Express API -> Next.js Frontend.
- How `zod` validation middleware protects the database integrity.
- React state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) and the Next.js App Router structure.

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

- **Search**: Implemented using PostgreSQL `iLike` for case-insensitive matching.
- **Client-side State**: Dashboard filters use local state. In a larger app, I would synchronize this with URL search parameters to make views shareable.
- **No Auth**: As per requirements, authentication was omitted to focus on core project tracking correctness.
- **Validation**: Strict validation on the backend ensures data integrity, trusting the frontend to handle the UI feedback.
- **Extra Field**: Added `budget` to the Project model as the permitted "one extra field" to demonstrate handling optional numeric data.
- **Framework Choice**: Used **Next.js** (based on React) instead of plain React (CRA/Vite) to leverage built-in routing, API proxying, and server-side rendering specific to standard "Full Stack" architectural patterns.
